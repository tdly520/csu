you can use Registry Editor or System Policy Editor.

To install this service, use the Network option in Control Panel, click
the Add button, select Service as the type of network component to
install, click the Add button, click the Have Disk button, and install
from the ADMIN\NETTOOLS\REMOTREG directory.
